Dingsbums PHP extension.

To install, perform the following steps (either automagical or manual 
installation):


(1) Automatical installation:
$ ./install.sh

Thanks to Carsten Rudolf Rudi Wiesbaum ;-)


(2) Manual installation:

$ phpize 
$ ./configure --enable-dingsbums 
! Now modify the `Makefile': append ``-L..db/db -ldb'' to the LDFLAGS and
! ``-I../db'' to the CFLAGS variable. !!
$ make 
$ sudo cp modules/dingsbums.so <PHP_EXTENSION_DIR>/dingsbums.so 
! The PHP_EXTENSION_DIR is something like ``/usr/lib/php5/20060613+lfs''.
! If you don't find it, search for it in the ``php.ini''.
! Now modify the ``php.ini'', search for the *.so extensions and add a line:
! ``extension=dingsbums.so''


Check the test.php.


IMPORTANT: The extension probably has memory leaks and is behind the development
of dingsbums database itself.
