SYNTAX:		COUNT ( <relation> )
	where	<relation> := '<query>'
SEMANTIC:	Determines the number of tuples in the relation.
IMPLEMENTATION:	The COUNT is a stored procedure whose sourcecode is located at
		sp/count.sps.
		Does nothing more than a fullscan and increment a counter
		for each tuple read. That's not the fastest way :-).
