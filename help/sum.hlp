SYNTAX:		SUM ( <relation>, <attribute> )
	where	<relation> := '<query>'
		<attribute> := '<attribute-name>' | <attribute-index>
SEMANTIC:	Calculates the sum of all tupels in the specified attribute.
		If the attribute's domain is STRING their strlen()s are 
		taken as values.
IMPLEMENTATION:	The joke is, that SUM isn't currently implemented at all. If
		it would be, it was an stored procedure whose sourcecode was
		located at sp/sum.sps.
