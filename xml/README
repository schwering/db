The XML-to-relational mapping for dingsbums.
Status: far from being stabled (almost untested).

It uses Xerces-C++ as XML parser.

Some points need to be said about it:

1. The code is written in C++, probably bad C++. The project's goal was to
   learn C++.

2. The only mapping implemented yet is a naive one that maps each element to
   one relation.
   One could implement additional mappings more or less easily.

3. There are still many issues with certain XML constructs.
   The most of them are still unknown (I guess). Those that I know include
   elements whose model is #PCDATA mixed with other XML code. 
   Such XML data cannot be processed at the moment.  The problem is twofold:
   Firstly, Xerces seems to handle these elements a way I don't understand
   (I didn't investigate it really yet, though), secondly the XMLElement class
   doesn't support it yet (i.e. if such constructs could be stored, they
   couldn't be read out of the database yet).

4. The query ``language'' is a subset of XPath. Maybe it even isn't a subset,
   but it's similar to the abbreviated syntax of XPath:
	/e/f/g
   returns content of the elements g in elements f in elements e.
   Nothing more is supported.
   It is planned (and the code is mostly prepared for it) to support some
   conditions for expressions like /e[a=Furz]/f/g or so.
